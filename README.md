# [Stroke Care Project](http://strokecare.uk) 

This is a research project which aims to improve the lives of stroke survivors with data.
There are two goals we are focusing on:
1. We are designing and developing patient portal that will allow patients to better self-manage their health data on a day-to-day basis;
2. We are trying to offer health providers and policymakers a smart dashboard that can help with ongoing improvements in clinical decision making.
