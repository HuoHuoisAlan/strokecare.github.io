Supporting ongoing improvements to meet patient needs has the great potential to transform their comprehension of disease on a day-to-day basis.
The power of the patient portal and stroke analytics dashboard will be assessed and evaluated through a study which will evaluate methods or guidelines used to generate information for stroke patients.
We will evaluate the patient portal components via four embedded feasibility randomised trials (years 3â€“5) which will explore the effect of portal usage on different subgroups of SLSR patients.
Health providers and researchers will also review the performance of the analytics portal through standardised quantitative measures and through custom-purpose questionnaires.
Finally, our team will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the patient portal and stroke analytics dashboard from technical, clinical, and economic views as well as social care viewpoints.
The integration of stakeholders engagement and patient and public involvement can provide comprehensive and new insights into designing and implementing data-driven clinical decision-making support systems
with increased productivity and transparency of the process.
