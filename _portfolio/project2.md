Informed by the data needs of the wide range of stakeholders, an online dashboard will be developed to facilitate the uptake of the 
projectâ€™s findings, serving as an information centre for policymakers, the research community and the wider public.
This dashboard is expected to optimise current clinical procedures by facilitating patient cohorts extraction, data integration, data ETL and exploratory data analysis for health providers and researchers.
With a close examination of longitudinal patient data, insightful features and trends will be used to help health providers improve clinical decision-making in a data-driven fashion.
Results will be accessible to a range of audiences using interactive visualisations, accompanied by a comprehensive guide to the nature and use of data.
