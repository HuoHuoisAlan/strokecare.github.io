Patient portals have received widespread support from policymakers and healthcare organisations as part of the 
shift towards personalised and digitised healthcare delivery, but significant implementation challenges have been 
identified. We are designing and developing a patient-centered solution for stroke survivors to report health data, access their personal health records, and understand their health data.
The use of data-backed decision making can help stroke patients make well-informed choices about actions to take in self-managing their conditions on a daily basis, adapting their long-term care.
