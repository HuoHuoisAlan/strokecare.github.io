Patient portals have received widespread support from policymakers and healthcare organisations as part of the 
shift towards personalised and digitised healthcare delivery, but significant implementation challenges have been 
identified. We are designing and developing a patient-centred solution for stroke survivors to report health data, access their health records, and understand their health data.
Using data-backed decision-making can help stroke patients make well-informed choices about actions to take in self-managing their conditions daily, adapting their long-term care.
